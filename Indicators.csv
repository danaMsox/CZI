"A1. Crew Leader uses Crew Time with IntentionRoutines and structures support Crew to run smoothly. This item captures the extent to which the Crew leader uses routines and structures in ways that use lesson time efficiently to support the goals of the Crew lesson.




Level 1 

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


Routines that support Crew objectives and transitions during the lesson are minimally evident or not evident. There is a fair to large amount of time not being used to achieve the lesson’s objectives.
The Crew is mostly working to achieve the lesson’s objectives. Transitions between activities run smoothly, and routines that support Crew objectives are evident.
The entire crew period is used to achieve the lesson's objectives. Transitions between activities run smoothly, and routines that support Crew objectives are evident.


",Evidence for A1,"A2. Crew Leader builds Student CommunityThis item describes how the Crew Leader sets up the classroom and facilitates lessons to support community building and give every student an opportunity to participate as themselves in Crew. This includes routines and structures that are in place to support students in times of disagreement and conflict. Crew lessons are designed to be utilized in a circle where all students have an opportunity to speak. If there are elements of the classroom setup that could better build student community, keep those elements in mind (e.g., seat organization, talking stick, Crew norms, and fidgets that support students’ listening and speaking to one another).




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


The classroom and lesson are designed and facilitated in a way that only allows a few students to have the opportunity to speak and be heard by others. Routines and structures are absent that support students in times of disagreement and conflict.
The classroom and lesson are designed and facilitated so most students have the opportunity to speak and be heard by others.Routines and structures that support students in times of disagreement and conflict are present to ensure respectful interactions among students but not implemented as well as they could be.
 The classroom and lesson are designed and facilitated so that nearly all students have the opportunity to speak and be heard by others.Routines and structures that support students in times of disagreement and conflict are present to ensure respectful interactions among students and are taken advantage of to deepen conversations and community.


",Evidence for A2,"A3. Student Crew FacilitationCrew is a place to help students see the big picture in which service to others, respect for themselves, and collaboration with one another are all part of changing the world. To empower students as not just members but leaders within a community, teachers can let go of sole responsibility for running the classroom and instead teach students how to collectively manage the Crew and classroom environment. Therefore, this item serves as a measure of where a Crew is on the journey of being led partially, or possibly entirely, by students.




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


 The Crew leader is exclusively facilitating the lesson and students are not given the opportunity to facilitate parts of the Crew lesson or discussions with other peers.
 Students are given opportunities to facilitate the Crew lesson, but the lesson is mostly teacher-driven. For example, the Crew leader shares knowledge or experiences in the lesson and group discussions in a way that takes away from students making connections and grappling with lesson content themselves. 
Students are facilitating or co-facilitating the entire Crew lesson; Crew leader may offer strategic support and whole group questioning to guide the lesson or discussion, but they are prioritizing student voice and students grappling with complicated topics. 


",Evidence for A3,B1. Student TalkFor how much of the lesson did students speak in comparison to the Crew leader,"B2. Crew Leader uses Student IdeasCrew is a time when students can learn how to listen to one another and share their own opinions and thoughts. This item describes the extent to which student ideas and explanations are used throughout the Crew lesson and the ways in which a Crew Leader facilitates discussions to draw from student voices to drive the lesson forward.If students are moving the lesson forward through interactive discussions that involve multiple student voices, you can use this as evidence that Crew leaders have modeled the inclusion of student ideas and solutions into lesson building.




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


The Crew leader is doing most of the speaking, limiting student contributions during discussions or not using what is said by students to drive the lesson.
The Crew leader is inviting students’ ideas and solutions into the discussions by asking questions in a teacher to student discussion style (i.e., students are not asking each other questions or responding to one another.).The Crew leader listens to students and uses student ideas and solutions, and uses them to move the lesson forward and adapt/enhance it.
The Crew leader is almost exclusively a listener and only interjects when necessary to help guide the lesson forward.Students listen to one another, ask each other questions, and build on one another's contributions. Students use their own and other students’ ideas and solutions to help move the lesson forward and adapt/enhance it.


",Evidence for B2,"B3. Students Co-construct ExplanationsThis item describes the ways in which students, prompted by themselves or others, provide an explanation for their ideas and responses that demonstrate a search for meaning while in Crew. In this manner, students prompt each other in ways that deepen practices that connect to becoming effective learners, ethical people, or contributing to a better world.This item is an extension of the ‘Crew Leader Uses Student Ideas.’ For this item, we want to dig deeply into the ways students explain their thinking and how they use evidence to support and connect their ideas to other concepts. 




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


Student talk is infrequent and/or students are not explaining or connecting their ideas to what was said before them.
Student talk is frequent, but students are largely not using evidence to support their ideas or making connections to other students’ ideas or explanations during Crew discussions. 
 Student talk is frequent, and students are using critical thinking to explain their ideas with evidence and/or connections to other students’ ideas and explanations during Crew discussions. 


",Evidence for B3,"C1. Crew Fosters Habits of CharacterHabits of Character are benchmarks for Crew and standards we hope that students use to work towards becoming effective learners, ethical people, and contributors to a better world. Conversations within Crew should build students’ mindsets and abilities around character habits and traits or others that the school has decided to include as a part of their framework (e.g., school core values).Crew lessons reinforce character traits as part of daily instruction by (a) discussing (i.e., “unpacking”) Habits of Character to clarify student understanding, (b) including planned reflection on Habits of Character within instructional routines and lessons, and (c) requiring students to track their progress related to desired Habits.Note: The lesson does not have to reference the school’s official Habits of Character, but should explicitly name the character trait central to the lesson. 




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


Work done in Crew does not reference a habit of character or character trait and how it can be fostered for students.
Work done in Crew directly applies to at least one habit of character or character trait, which is explicitly state in the lesson. Reference to the character trait is embedded within, at the very least, a few parts of the Crew lesson (e.g., the reading, activity, and reflection).
The habit of character or character trait is explicitly stated in the lesson. All parts of the lesson draw directly from at least one habit of character or character trait, with moments where students discuss the ways in which the habit of character or character trait builds students’ own development as an effective learner, ethical person, or contributor to a better world.


",Evidence for C1,"C2. Crew Fosters Opportunities for Reflective MomentsThis item captures student engagement in deep reflection and reasoning as it applies to them and their development of character. Crew should push students to reflect on past experiences, scenarios, etc., and develop competencies that allow them to become more effective learners, more ethical people, and ultimately, to contribute to a better world.This item should not be confounded with the difficulty of the task or whether it is appropriate for a certain grade level. It is about the ways in which students are reflecting in ways that push themselves as individuals. Reflection should take place throughout the lesson. The debrief should not be the only place during Crew where students are asked to reflect.It is important to consider that reflection and recall are two distinct practices of student engagement. In this rubric, we are focused on identifying places where students are reflecting on their learning, NOT just recalling their experiences or learning. 




Level 1

Level 3 (Baseline)
Level 5


The crew lesson provides opportunity for recall but little or no opportunities for students to reflect individually and in community with one another (e.g., making connections between learnings and experiences; analyzing a situation or scenario).
The crew lesson provides some opportunities for students to reflect individually and in community with one another (e.g., making connections between learnings and experiences; analyzing a situation or scenario).
